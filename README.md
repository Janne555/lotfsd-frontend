## User guide
You can register to create a new account or use the demo account; username: demo1, password: hei@123ABC

A password must have lower and upper cased characters, a special character and numbers and must be atleast 8 characters long.

After logging in you can create a new character sheet or choose one from the character menu.

### Character sheet
The character sheet page displays information about the selected character. Here you can adjust your ability scores and add equipment, retainers, languages and properties to your character

### Item index
The item index page is where items can be viewed and created. Creting a new item opens a form where you can specify the item type and depending on that type what properties the item has. Weapons have damage and range, armor has a base armor class and regular items. The new effect property has not been implemented yet.
